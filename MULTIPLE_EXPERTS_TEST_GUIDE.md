# Multiple Expert Conversations - Test Guide

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

The chat system now supports **multiple simultaneous conversations** with different experts:

### ✅ **Backend Improvements:**
1. **Separate Conversations**: Customers can now have individual conversations with each expert
2. **Expert-Specific Logic**: Conversations are tracked per expert, not globally per customer
3. **Proper Reuse**: Existing conversations with specific experts are reused correctly
4. **Quick Consultation**: General consultations (no specific expert) still work

### ✅ **Frontend Improvements:**
1. **Visual Differentiation**: Each expert has different colored avatars
2. **Conversation Counter**: Shows total number of active conversations
3. **Status Indicators**: Color-coded status badges and borders
4. **Conversation IDs**: Shows unique conversation identifiers
5. **Better Navigation**: Improved back button and header information

## 🧪 How to Test Multiple Expert Conversations

### **Step 1: Setup**
1. Ensure backend is running: `docker compose up --build`
2. Ensure frontend is running: `cd SkinCare-Frontend && bun run dev`
3. Make sure you have a customer account (sign up if needed)

### **Step 2: Test Multiple Conversations**

#### **Customer Side Testing:**
1. Go to `http://localhost:5173/consult`
2. Sign in with your customer account
3. **Start conversation with Dr. Sarah Johnson** (Acne & Oily Skin)
   - Click "Start Consultation" on her card
   - Send a message: "Hello Dr. Sarah, I have oily skin issues"
4. **Go back** to the main consultation page (click ← button)
5. **Start conversation with Dr. Emily Chen** (Anti-Aging & Dry Skin)
   - Click "Start Consultation" on her card
   - Send a message: "Hello Dr. Emily, I need anti-aging advice"
6. **Verify**: You should now see **2 separate conversations** in "My Conversations" section

#### **Expert Side Testing:**
1. Open **two separate browser windows/tabs**
2. **Window 1**: Go to `http://localhost:5173/expert`
   - Login as Dr. Sarah: `sarah@skincare.com` / `hello`
   - Accept and respond to the oily skin conversation
3. **Window 2**: Go to `http://localhost:5173/expert`
   - Login as Dr. Emily: `emily@skincare.com` / `hello`
   - Accept and respond to the anti-aging conversation

### **Step 3: Verify Real-Time Chat**
1. **Customer**: Switch between conversations and chat with both experts
2. **Experts**: Each expert should only see their assigned conversations
3. **Messages**: Should appear in real-time in the correct conversations

## 🎨 Visual Indicators

- **Dr. Sarah Johnson**: Blue avatar and accents
- **Dr. Emily Chen**: Purple avatar and accents
